# Final Assignments
## Troubleshoot a Significant Problem
> Instructions: "Problem solving is a core skill in systems librarianship and systems administration. At some point in our work this semester, each of you will encounter a significant hurdle. When you face this problem, you will need to solve it without asking for help and by referring to documentation, by searching the web (forums, etc), etc. 
> For this assignment, you will need to describe the problem you encountered and then show how you solved the problem by primarily referring to the official documentation for some software and/or by using a search engine to locate similar issues.
> Your assignment should be reflective and analytical. That is, you need to describe the problem and the solution in detail. I leave it to you to identify what 'in detail' means as it pertains to the problem. You should also include a short reflection on the whole event."
